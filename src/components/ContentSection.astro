    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>We build reusable front-end tooling for 2D and 3D applications. Our libraries and components help developers create interactive experiences without reinventing the wheel. We also develop video games and create assets for game development.</p>

    <h2>Our Focus</h2>
    <p>Our work spans from low-level rendering utilities to complete interactive systems. Whether it's physics-based UI elements, canvas rendering pipelines, or 3D asset management tools, we build the infrastructure that powers creative applications.</p>

    <h2>Tools We Build</h2>
    <p>We create libraries for real-time graphics, physics simulations, and interactive overlays. Our tools are designed to be modular, performant, and easy to integrate into existing projects. Everything we ship is built from real production needs.</p>

    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>All Blorkfield staff are currently engaged under existing contracts. We are not available for outside work at this time. As contracts conclude, we may open up availability for select projects depending on scheduling and scope.</p>

    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p>This site serves as the home for our public-facing work, including tools we release and games we develop. Check out our products page to see what we've shipped, and keep an eye out for future releases.</p>
